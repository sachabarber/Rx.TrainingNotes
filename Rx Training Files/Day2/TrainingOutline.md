#Training with Adaptive

##Practical Rx (.NET) - 2 Days
By the end of this course the candidates will have acquired the set of skills that allow them to embrace programming in a reactive manner. 
These skills will extend their ability to reason about, visualize and communicate various concurrent and asynchronous workflow problems. 
With the deeper understanding of the challenges of asynchronous and concurrent coding, the candidate will be able to create elegant solutions to these challenges through educated design decisions.


The primary focus of the training will be to gain a deep understanding of Rx and how best to apply it. 
This session will cover application development for both client and server, with elective challenges targeting Desktop, Web, and Data-store technologies.


This course will be a mix of lectures, sample code and hands on coding challenges. 
Candidates will be encouraged to interact with the presenter and other candidates. 
Candidates are expected to provide their own laptop with a version of Visual Studio that supports .NET 4.5, and have a working understanding of C#.
